                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>The Children's Museum of Atlanta has a lot of great exhibits in a vast variety of learning concepts, but their new area in science and engineering was lacking in engaging exhibits. The CMoA asked Georgia Tech students to design and create museum exhibit concepts that embodied curiosity, creativity, and STEM learning concepts to enhance the new science and engineering area of the museum. </p>

                <div class="col-md-6" style="padding-top: 50px;">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Our team designed the Molecule Forest: an interactive exhibit that subtly instills broads concepts of atoms and molecule creation. The exhibit is mostly designed to create a collaborative medium for children to practice motor skills, teamwork skills, critical thinking skills, all while learning a more complex concept in science.</p>

                        <p>As a part of our initial research, we made a visit to the Children's Museum of Atlanta to talk with their executives about the museum, their needs, and their pain points. We arrived before the museum was open to discuss the exhibits and take pictures, and then we stayed when the museum opened to observe how the museum guests interacted with their current exhibits. We took notes about what we saw was working and what was not working with the exhibits in the museum. This would help inform our design decisions later.</p>

                    <p>Taking our survey results, we decided to delve into the realm of Alexa Skills and popular voice ordering technologies in order to understand what works for these technologies and how our team could gain a better understanding on how Moe's can fit into voice technologies. We also conducted <b>task analyses</b> on some of these systems to help better understand how they worked.</p>

                    <h3>Pivot!!</h3>
                    <p>After discussing the results from our competitive analysis, we realized that there was a fundamental issue with the way we were approaching this problem. Currently, we had been approaching the problem from a "top-down" approach, that is, figuring out how Moe's can fit into voice. After lots of discussion, we knew that Moe's could really only fit into voice through only a few means - including food and ordering. Based off of our research, we knew that voice ordering was not very well received, so we were stumped on other ways that Moe's could fit into voice. </p>
                    <p>After this discussion, we decided on a better approach. It made it easier for our team to think of design ideas based off of our research if we looked at it from a "bottom-up" approach, that is, figuring out ways that voice can fit into Moe's. This mentality freed ourselves to think outside of the box on the ways that popular voice technology ideas can be incorporated into the Moe's brand.</p>

                    <p>After our pivot, we decided to conduct another survey to ask more about the "Why" behind voice interaction, instead of focusing our energy on Moe's experiences and food ordering. We had 103 participants for this survey.</p>

                    <h5>Is there anything else you would like to add about why you use voice interaction technology?</h5>
                    <img src="img/burritoquest/wordcloud3.png" style="width:50%;">
                    <h4 style="padding-top:20px;">Takeaways</h4>
                    <p>• <b>Our voice technology needs to be simple.</b> This is because participants most often use voice technologies for simple tasks, such as playing music, checking the weather, asking questions, calling and texting, asking for directions, and setting an alarm</p>
                    <p>• <b>Our interactions do not necessarily need to be private</b>, since participants use voice technologies both alone and with people</p>
                    <p>• <b>Convenience and entertainment</b> are two key reasons why our participants used voice technologies, so catering our design concepts around these ideas would be best</p>

                    <p>Taking this concept feedback, we constructed a more detailed prototype to use in the usability testing phase. We kept the Wizard of Oz scenario since it was cheap and quick, and would allow us to make easier changes to the prototype while still allowing it to be customized to the voice and atmosphere we wanted to create. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The prototype can be found by downloading the Keynote presentation at the top of the page. It's functionality can be used by following the flow of the presentation based off of the user's responses to the story. An example of this flow is below.</p>

Instead of using Neilsen's 10 heuristics, since they did not quite meet the functionality we were trying to improve with a voice interaction system, we decided to use <b>"heuristics" from Amazon Alexa's Design Guide</b>, found <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-design/design-voice.html">here</a>. The design guidelines we chose participants to evaluate are listed below.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>• <b>Earcons were generally well received, and enhanced the experience.</b> However, they could also be added in the background during the user’s interaction as not to have an abrupt stop when waiting for a response.</p>
                    <p>• <b>The visual handout was also generally well received</b>, and participants liked having it as an option. While some participants said that they did not think it was necessary to have, they also all agreed that it enhanced their experience and liked to reference it whenever they felt like it.</p>
                    <p>• <b>The points system could be improved</b>, including making the rewards more relevant in the game, making it more obvious how the points system works, or making it more obvious how many points the user has as they move through the game. Evaluators also expressed that the point system might not be for all users (Moe’s Rewards members and others), so design accordingly.</p>
                    <p>• <b>Narration is a key aspect of this interaction</b>, and should be emphasized in the system. However, the length of narration and the character interaction could be improved to make the user more engaged.</p>
                    <p>• <b>Interactions are overall very simple</b>, which makes it easy to progress through the story.</p>

                    <p>In addition to an expert evaluation, we wanted general user feedback into some key components of Burrito Quest, such as the storyline and its interaction components, the points system, the visual map, and the minigames.</p>

                    <h4>Results from Interactive User Demo and Feedback</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>• <b>Overall, engagement in the story was high</b>, and no participants had trouble identifying their next moves in the story. Laughing and smiling could be identified throughout the story, and all participants answered to having high rates of enjoyment while interacting with the story.</p>
                    <p>• <b>The minigame duration was too long</b>, and should be shortened by about 25%.</p>
                    <p>• <b>Participants were split by the story having too little or too much narration</b>. Some participants felt that it could use more narration, while others felt that they wanted less narration, and more interaction with the story. This is an idea to keep in mind in the future, as we develop the narration between personal preferences.</p>
                    <p>• <b>The rewards system was still confusing</b>, and should be made more clear at the beginning of the interaction and during the story. For instance, during the story, instead of just saying "You just won 30 rewards points," we could include an option for the user to say "How many total points do I have?" where the system would then say, "You now have 65 out of 500 rewards points, and you need 35 more to redeem a free queso!"</p>
                    <p>• <b>Options to go backwards or jump to a certain point in the story</b> would be ideal for users who either made a mistake in their interaction choice, or are replaying the game and would like to skip to certain aspects of the story.</p>

                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>• Designing voice technologies is tough, and requires studying and implementing certain design guidelines for voice in order to design it correctly.</p>
                    <p>• When it comes to brainstorming a system for a unique technology that might not quite fit a certain brand, it's important to think more outside-of-the-box on how their brand could fit successfully into a less-explored technology.</p>
                    <p>• The most obvious solution (in this instance, food ordering), may not always be the best one. It takes lots of research to determine what exactly would be best to create. This means not relying on your own assumptions as a designer before any research, but allowing the research to guide you in your process to create the best solutions for your users.</p>

                <div class="col-xl-12" style="padding-top:50px;">
                    <h3>Future Considerations</h3>
                    <p>• How do we expand this concept to a fully-fledged system? How long should the duration of the game be to win a free burrito, and what research would we need to do in order to solidify the rest of the story?</p>
                    <p>• What are our limitations on voice technology? Since this was only a prototype, actually programming the system may cause us to face new challenges, especially in terms of the minigames, or other complicated interactions. Several design decisions may need to be made at that point depending on the limitations of the system.</p>
                    <p>• How might we need to change the points system to comply with what Moe's standards are in terms of coupons?</p>
                    <p>• What can we do to encourage replayability for this system? For instance, might we change the storyline every few months for a fresh new game, or have new rewards, or both?</p>
