                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>For a large insurance company, tracking claims are integral to customer security and trust. Customers want to know when their claim has been processed, when it’s moving along, and when they have items in the claim that they need to address. However, for customers using the app, there were a lot of issues with the claim tracking process. Steps were not clear, and it was hard to see how much time a certain process would take. In addition, information about a claim was hard to find through the current organization of the page.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6" style="padding-top: 50px;">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>During my internship, a UX designer, content strategist, and I were tasked with coming up with a redesign for this process that would align with brand standards and website standards, and would create a better user experience. We would collaborate with developers, technology analysts, and UX researchers to determine the best solution that would help customers better understand where they were in the claims process and help better find important information relating to their claim.</p>

                         <p>Before I could design anything, I needed to understand how the claims process worked. How do customers file a claim? Once they file a claim, what are the next steps that they take? What are the different kinds of claims, and how are they different? Is there anything the customer has to do for the claim to keep progressing? How does the customer talk to the company, get repairs, and pay for services for their claim? In addition to learning all of this, I also had to understand </p>

                        <p>Steps were used to indicate where the user was in their claims process. In this redesign, we decided to also change the way that we designate the steps in the process. The old process consisted of 3 steps, but in the new progress, we decided to go with 5 steps that would be more descriptive of the status of the claim. The change would be as follows:</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                    <div class=col-lg-11 style="padding-top:20px; padding-left: 50px;">
                        <br>
                        <h5> 1. Make sure the action items are visible on the screen</h5>
                        <p> Most users were confused by red and gray bars only to indicate “Required” and “Recommended” tasks, so make sure the wording is present for each task</p>
                        <h5> 2. Make sure users know what tasks are “Required” and “Recommended”</h5>
                        <p> Most users claimed they would click on ”Repair and Rental” in the timeline to request a rental, and some went to the action item for “Request a Rental”, so it was important to make the action items obvious.</p>
                        <h5> 3. Make sure there is a visual status to show the user’s position in the claim process</h5>
                        <p> Most users preferred the page to have a visual indicator for the status.</p>
                        <h5> 4. Make sure all steps are shown on the screen with sufficient detail</h5>
                        <p> Most users preferred seeing both completed and future steps in the claims process, and liked having lots of details about each step pertaining to their claim.</p>

                    <h3>Exploratory Design</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since this redesign was to take a new direction, I needed to understand how best to tackle the different sections of the process.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>Visual Tracking</h4>
                    <p>First, I explored the different ways I could design the visual tracking steps for the claims process. I researched competitors in order to understand how competitors were designing their tracking processes on mobile. This included Domino’s pizza tracker and Delta’s flight tracker. </p>
                     <div class="row" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;">
                        <div class="col-xl-12">
                            <img src="img/claimtracking/progress_tracking.png">
                         </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>The blue was an integral part of the design since blue was the design standard for insurance on the app. However, given the newfound design direction that the app was undergoing in order to align better to brand and alleviate colors, like blue, for different uses, I decided to shift the colors to red. Numbered steps were also important to include on the visuals, since it can better show the idea of progress towards the last numbered goal.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>Circular Progress Indicator</h4>
                    <p>Next, I explored the different ways I could design a visual to quickly represent the step the user was currently on. Since the web team was exploring the same topic, I collaborated with them to come up with a solution. The web team had come up with the idea of the circular progress indicator to denote the steps. In order to maintain consistency across channels, I adopted the circular progress indicator, and brainstormed different color treatments that would best indicate completed steps and current steps.</p>
                    <div class="row" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;">
                        <div class="col-xl-12">
                            <img src="img/claimtracking/progress_cpi.png">
                         </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Accessibility issues caused me to stay away from different colors that could be misinterpreted through color-blindness for past, current, and future steps. I landed on a solution that maintained consistent colors, but clearly indicated the current step in the middle of the circle.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>Action Items</h4>
                    <p>Next, I explored the different ways I could integrate the action items into the new design. Previously, the action items were placed on cards, but had no indication whether or not the items were required or optional. There were also some concerns on the length of the screen, so I decided in addition to redesigning the cards, I would also come up with ideas to make the list of cards less minimal on the screen.</p>
                    <div class="row" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;">
                        <div class="col-xl-12">
                            <img src="img/claimtracking/progress_actionitems.png">
                         </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Since action items are so crucial, we decided that they needed to be more front and center than other items related to the claims process. Because of this, we decided to go with the redesigned cards that would clearly define which actions are required, and which are recommended.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>Information Structure</h4>
                    <p>In addition to the items important for tracking, I also needed to provide quick access to information related to the claim, like coverages, photos, payments, and claim information. I designed many interations in conjunction to the pieces above to understand the best heirarchy and importance of accessible information.</p>
                    <div class="row" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;">
                        <div class="col-xl-12">

                            <p>1. What is the most important information to the user? This was deemed to be the current step the user was on in their claim, and what they needed to do next to keep their claim moving along. Because of this, we highlighted the current step and the action items all at the top.</p>
                             <p>2. How were we going to label certain items on the page? We had to ensure that the labeling was consistent in tone and voice, and was succinct enough for the user to accurately find information without overcrowding the screen.</p>
                             <p>3. What else is important for a user’s claim? Aside from tracking, we also had to consider the information contained within the claim, such as policy info, pictures, and payments, and how to properly convey where that information was stored. We created a hierarchy of information in order of most relevance for the user based on data gained from analysts.</p>

                    <p>For these usability tests, one UX researcher asked each participant to perform a series of tasks on the claim tracking screen, including tasks such as viewing their progress on their claim, or uploading a picture to their claim. The UX Research time compiled the results of the test, and shared it to the design team.</p>

                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>• Collaboration across teams is essential to align with design goals and to make sure everyone is on the same page.</p>
                    <p>• Designing in industry is a lot different from designing in academia. A lot of shortcuts have to be made for the sake of time and resources. However, as designers, we have to be flexible and adapt to achieve great experiences for our users.</p>
                    <p>• For every questioned answered about the product space, there will be 10 more to take its place. Communication is key to understanding the problem space to address it properly and holistically.</p>
                    <p>• My Sketch and Invision skills improved as I learned more about symbols, libraries, and plugins to streamline the prototyping process.</p>

                    <h3>Future Considerations</h3>
                    <p>• Based on UX research, users liked seeing the timeline more than the overview. How might be design the timeline into the forefront of the experience?</p>
                    <p>• How might be integrate all aspects of the claim process (action items, uploads, steps, and timeline) into one seamless experience?</p>
                    <p>• How might be redesign the circular progress indicator to be more indicative of the user's steps in the process (if a visual indicator is needed at all)?</p>
